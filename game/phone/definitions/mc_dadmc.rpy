    "dadmc" "Unblock your mother."
    "mc" "Or what"
    "dadmc" "So help me, I will come back there."
    "mc" "Oh will you?"
    "mc" "Last I checked, you couldn't give a damn about me"
    "mc" "You dropping work for any reason is so far off the cards that I don't believe for a second you'd be back in the country for anything short of my goddamn funeral"
    "dadmc" "What do you want from me?"
    "mc" "She doesn't deserve to be unblocked."
    "mc" "Not after what she did"
    "dadmc" "You didn't give her a chance to explain."
    "mc" "If I wanted to hear bullshit excuses, I'd talk to a cow."
    "mc" "Oh, wait."
    "dadmc" "I understand that you're angry, but think more rationally about this situation."
    "dadmc" "If anything were to happen to you while you're home alone, you need someone in the country to lean on."
    "dadmc" "As much as I loathe the thought of it being that woman, you have little choice."
    "mc" "Bite me."

    "dadmc" "Happy fifteenth birthday, Melody. I'm sorry I can't be home for it."

    time hour 18 minute 41
    "mc" "You haven't been home in well over a year. If you were sorry, you'd have made an effort."

    time month 5 day 29 year 2017 hour 19 minute 44
    "dadmc" "I'll be home for your birthday this year."
    "mc" "That'd be a bloody miracle. I haven't heard from you in almost three years."
    "dadmc" "I know. I've made some mistakes, and I'd like to start correcting them."
    "dadmc" "I'll be home for an entire month. If you don't want me at the house, I'll stay elsewhere, but I will be around."
    "mc" "You think a month makes up for the fact that you've not been home since 2013?"
    "dadmc" "It doesn't, and I don't."
    "dadmc" "But it's a step in the right direction."
    "mc" "Do you know what age I was when I last saw you?"
    "dadmc" "Thirteen, approaching your fourteenth birthday."
    "mc" "And what age will I be when you see me again?"
    "dadmc" "I'll hopefully be home before your birthday, but, you'll be eighteen this year."
    "mc" "Yes. Yes I will."
    "dadmc" "I don't expect you to forgive me."
    "dadmc" "All I ask is that you hear me out when I get there."
    "mc" "You didn't come to my middle school graduation, and I'm assuming you won't be coming to my actual graduation at the start of next year, is that right?"
    "dadmc" "I will make an effort to be there."
    "mc" "That's rich."
    "dadmc" "I know."
    "dadmc" "I have a present for you, when I get there."
    "dadmc" "I haven't spent all this time doing nothing. You'll be pleasantly surprised by what I have for you."
    "mc" "I don't think I will."
    "dadmc" "In any case, say hello to Sayori for me. She's..."
    "dadmc" "Just keep an eye on her."
    "mc" "What I do is none of your business."
    "dadmc" "Very well."

    "dadmc" "Happy birthday, Melody. I'm sorry I couldn't make it for the day, but I will be touching down at the airport in about twelve hours. I should be home before you go to bed."
