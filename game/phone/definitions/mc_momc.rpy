    "momc" "What did you say to your father?"
    "mc" "When?"
    "momc" "He seems to be under the impression that I'm leaving the house to get away from him when he's home. What did you say?"
    "mc" "I asked him where you go when you leave, and why you leave only whenever he's around."
    "momc" "Why would you do that?"
    "mc" "Because I was curious?"
    "mc" "And because if you're having a problem, you need to talk about it."
    "mc" "I told him that whatever problems you're having, they won't last forever. You need to work through them, not just get upset and storm out of the house"
    "momc" "Who gave you the right to butt into problems that aren't your own?"
    "mc" "They become my problems when they involve me every single day"
    "momc" "You're impossible."
    "mc" "No, I'm highly improbable. The fact that I exist lends itself credence to the fact that I must, therefore, be possible."

    "momc" "Come home straight after school."
    "mc" "Or what?"
    "momc" "Do NOT backchat."
    "mc" "I'm going to Sayori's for the night"
    "mc" "I don't care about whatever you have to say"
