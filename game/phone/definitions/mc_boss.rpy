    "b" "Hey kid, would you mind getting an early start today?"
    "mc" "I can do that. What time?"
    "b" "As soon as you can get here?"
    "mc" "Sounds good"

    time month 8 day 30 hour 7 minute 15
    "b" "Happy birthday, kid. Take the day off if you want."
    "mc" "No, it’s fine. I’ll be there"

    "b" "Hey, kid, my back’s playing up again. Is there any chance you could run the shop today?"
    "mc" "Yeah, of course"
    "mc" "I had nothing better to do today, at least."
    "b" "I really appreciate it, kid. It’ll be worth your while."
    "mc" "It always is, don’t worry"
    "b" "I don’t know what I’d do without you."
    "mc" "I feel the same way, honestly"
    "b" "Ah, don’t get all sappy on me, kid. You’ve come a long way since we first met. You’re more than capable, compared to back then."

    time month 12 day 5 hour 15 minute 40
    "mc" "Hey, Boss, I’m feeling a little under the weather, would it be a major issue if I took the day off tomorrow?"
    "b" "Not at all, kid. You’ve been putting in a lot over extra hours lately, one day off won’t break either of our backs."
    "b" "Well, hopefully! Haha!"
    "mc" "Thank you, I appreciate it"

    time month 1 day 9 year 2015 hour 14 minute 45
    "b" "Feel like working extra tomorrow?"
    "mc" "Sure"
    "b" "Open sound good?"
    "mc" "Yeah, I can do that"
    "b" "Fantastic, I’ll see you then, kid."

    time day 23 hour 9 minute 22
    "b" "How does some extra work tomorrow sound? I forgot to ask while you were in."
    "mc" "Sure"
    "b" "Open to close?"
    "mc" "Long one. I can manage that."
    "b" "Fantastic, I’ll put you on with the new kid, was hoping you’d train him a little."
    "mc" "Oh, that’s what it is. Yeah, that’s totally fine"
    "b" "Good to hear. I won’t be there tomorrow, gotta head a couple towns over for a delivery."
    "mc" "That’s alright, I can handle it."
    "b" "You’re a lifesaver, kid."

    time month 3 day 14 hour 5 minute 42
    "b" "Early start today?"
    "mc" "Yeah, I’ll get there as soon as I can"

    time month 4 day 10 hour 16 minute 30
    "b" "You alright, kid? You’ve been a little out of sorts the past couple weeks."
    "mc" "Yeah, I’m fine. Just... an anniversary."
    "b" "Ah..."
    "b" "Would you like some time off?"
    "mc" "No, I can’t afford it."
    "b" "Kid, if you’re struggling, take some time off. You’ve built up a bit of an egg nest; you can afford to take a week off to recover."
    "mc" "..."
    "mc" "Alright, I’ll take you up on that"
    "b" "Let me know when you’re ready to return to work, alright?"
    "b" "Take your time, and don’t push yourself too hard."
    "mc" "I won’t"

    time day 17 hour 11 minute 20
    "mc" "Any chance you’ve got some work for me tomorrow?"
    "b" "For you? Of course."
    "b" "You don’t have to come back so soon, but I won’t say no."
    "mc" "I’ll be alright"
    "mc" "Just took a bit out of me is all"
    "b" "I can tell. As long as you’re feeling up to it, there’s as much work as you can handle. I’ve just had some new slots open up in the afternoons, so you can get some work cleaning and handling some stocktake when you’re free."
    "mc" "Really?"
    "b" "Yep, some after school work to keep you out of trouble. I’ll spend some time training you over the next couple weeks."
    "mc" "That would be amazing!"

    time month 6 day 23 hour 14 minute 58
    "b" "Hey, kid, I’ve just had something come up, and I won’t be around for the next week. Gotta head into Tokyo."
    "b" "Means no-one will be there to run the shop."
    "mc" "Did you want me to run it?"
    "b" "For the entire week?"
    "mc" "Better than leaving it closed, isn’t it?"
    "b" "Kid, I don’t know if you’re really ready to run the place alone for that long, but I appreciate the sentiment."
    "mc" "No, I’ve been studying up. I know how to work and clean every piece of equipment, and I’ve memorised almost every recipe. Even if I have to work in a reduced capacity, I will."
    "b" "What about handling orders and the like?"
    "mc" "I can do all that; you’ve shown it to me."
    "b" "Still, I can’t leave someone underage running the shop, kid."
    "mc" "You could leave Katherine on with me, she’s old enough."
    "b" "But she’s only been there a couple months, I can’t force her to shoulder that burden."
    "mc" "No, but with my help, we can manage."
    "mc" "It’s better than leaving the store closed for a week."
    "b" "Do you really think you can handle it?"
    "mc" "I do."
    "b" "If Katherine agrees to take the temporary position of manager, and you work as assistant manager, you might just pull this off."
    "b" "I’ll ask her."
    "mc" "Alright."

    time hour 15 minute 42
    "b" "Katherine agreed to work full-time for the next week, alongside you."
    "mc" "Alright. I’ll take some leave off school and make it happen."
    "b" "You’re good people, kid. I’m leaving the place in good hands."
    "mc" "I know. Thank you for trusting me."
    "b" "Hah, no worries."

    time month 8 day 30 hour 13 minute 22
    "b" "Happy birthday, kid. Hope school is going well for you this week."
    "mc" "It is, thanks. I’ve been keeping on top of things well enough"
    "b" "Hah, good to hear. I’ve got a surprise for you, when you come in this weekend. Got you a small gift."
    "mc" "Oh, you didn’t have to"
    "b" "I know I didn’t have to, but it’s probably the only one you’re getting this year."
    "mc" "Yeah."
    "b" "It’s the least I can do for you, kid."
    "mc" "I really, really appreciate it."
    "b" "I know you do, that’s why I do it."

    time month 11 day 14 hour 11 minute 42
    "b" "Hey kid, while you’re out back, can you grab a fresh loaf of wholemeal?"
    "mc" "Sure"

    time month 1 day 1 year 2016 hour 9 minute 25
    "b" "Happy new year, kid. The shop will be open tomorrow, if you want some extra hours. It’ll be busy."
    "mc" "Sounds like a good time"
    "b" "That’s not what I’d call it, but sure."
    "mc" "I’ll be there, don’t worry. Can’t let you have all the fun"
    "b" "You’ve definitely got spirit, that’s for certain."
    "mc" "Always did"
    "b" "Haha, that’s true. I’ll see you tomorrow, kid."

    time month 3 day 12 hour 4 minute 21
    "mc" "Hey Boss, I’ve just woken up and I feel awful. I hate to do this on such short notice, but could I call in sick today?"

    time hour 5 minute 11
    "b" "Of course, kid. Don’t want you spreading anything. Go get some sleep, and you can pick up the slack over the week."
    "mc" "Thank you. Yeah, I’ll do just that."

    time day 23 hour 14 minute 40
    "b" "Hey kid, how’s the new app working for you? I know I sprung it on you pretty suddenly, but it’s been working for everyone else so far in terms of being able to pick up shifts."
    "mc" "Really well, actually. It’s a lot easier to see when you’ve got available slots for me to grab."
    "b" "Sounds good. I’ll text you if anything’s ever urgent, but that rarely happens these days."
    "mc" "Yeah. Calling me is probably easier though, if I’m honest, when it’s that urgent."
    "b" "Sounds like a plan, kid."
